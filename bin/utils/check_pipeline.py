"""OFS Data Processing Pipeline Tracking and Visualization Utility.

This script audits and tracks the progression of physical oceanographic and
meteorological station data through a linear 7-stage processing pipeline
within an Operational Forecast System (OFS). It validates baseline inventory
existence against configured control files and directory assets, outputs a
structured summary matrix in CSV format, and generates highly optimized,
dual-axis heatmap charts.

Pipeline Developmental Stages:
    1. **In Inventory**: Station is registered in the baseline inventory and
       configured to monitor the given parameter.
    2. **In OBS CTL**: Station is successfully declared in the observation
       control file (`.ctl`).
    3. **OBS Generated**: The raw observation file (`.obs`) has been pulled
       and written to disk.
    4. **In Model CTL**: Station is declared in the numerical model's
       control file.
    5. **PRD Generated**: The model prediction file (`.prd`) has been successfully
       simulated and written.
    6. **INT Generated**: The interpolated paired file (`.int`) mapping observation
       to model grids has been successfully built.
    7. **HTML Generated**: The final localized web-visualization product (`.html`)
       is complete.

Drop reasons (joined from the station-drop ledger):
    The 7-stage matrix says how far a station got; it does not say why it
    stopped. When the skill run has left a combined station-drop ledger at
    `control_files/station_ledger_{ofs}.csv`, three extra columns are
    appended to the summary CSV -- `Drop_Stage`, `Drop_Reason`, and
    `Bins_Pruned`.

    `Drop_Stage`/`Drop_Reason` carry the earliest recorded stage that
    dropped the station and its explanation (e.g. `node_match` / "nearest
    model location 6.2 km away (> 4.0 km cutoff)"). They are populated only
    when this audit's own matrix agrees that the station stalled: a ledger
    reason is shown only if the station has a `No` at or after the column
    that stage would have blocked (see `LEDGER_STAGE_MIN_COLUMN`). A station
    that reached all seven stages is never annotated as dropped, whatever
    the ledger holds -- ledger rows are per bin for ADCP currents and can be
    left over from a run whose stages this run never re-executed.

    `Bins_Pruned` counts CO-OPS ADCP virtual bins the skill run removed
    because they sat below the model bottom. That is routine for shallow
    stations and is deliberately kept out of `Drop_Stage`: the parent
    station is still assessed on its remaining bins. It becomes the drop
    reason only when the station is itself missing from the model control
    file, i.e. nothing survived the prune.

    Ledger rows stamped `whichcast=all` describe artifacts shared by every
    cast and are applied to each audited whichcast; rows for a different
    `filetype` (a `-t fields` run) are skipped, since this tool audits the
    `stations` product. All three columns are left blank when no ledger file
    is present, so older output directories still audit cleanly. The
    heatmaps are unaffected: they select their columns by name.

Visual Chunking & Provider Grouping Rules (threshold = MAX_STATIONS_PER_PLOT):
    - **Combined Mode**: If the cumulative unique stations for a variable is at or
      below the threshold, all observation data sources are consolidated into one
      unified master chart (`_combined.png`).
    - **Provider Split Mode**: If total stations exceed the threshold, the script
      groups stations strictly by data provider (e.g., `CO-OPS`, `NDBC`, `USGS`),
      generating separate layout charts per supplier.
    - **Deep Sub-Chunking**: If a single provider's underlying station list itself
      exceeds the threshold, it is sub-divided into cleanly numbered multi-part
      files (e.g., `_usgs_pt_1.png`, `_usgs_pt_2.png`).

def generate_visualizations(csv_file_path, home_dir, ofs):
    """Reads the pipeline summary CSV and generates ultra-tight, side-by-side heatmaps.

    This function processes pipeline completion statuses across 7 linear tracking
    stages for every monitored variable and forecast type (whichcast). Each grid
    cell represents a stage's completion status (Green/True for completed, Red/False
    for missing) and is explicitly annotated with a bold, single-character indicator
    denoting its original data provider (e.g., 'C' for CO-OPS, 'U' for USGS, 'N' for NDBC).

    To preserve high visual fidelity and text readability:
    1. **Adaptive Chunking Strategy**: If the total station count for a variable is
       at or below MAX_STATIONS_PER_PLOT, all providers are bundled together into a
       single master plot file (`_combined.png`). If the station count exceeds the
       threshold, the function pivots to group stations strictly by their data
       provider, outputting one file per source.
    2. **Deep Sub-chunking**: If a single data provider's internal station count
       exceeds MAX_STATIONS_PER_PLOT, it is sub-divided into numbered files (e.g.,
       `_usgs_pt_1.png`, `_usgs_pt_2.png`).
    3. **Anti-Squishing Layout**: The vertical dimensions are automatically scaled
       with a floor constraint of 6.5 inches. This prevents sparse station selections
       from flattening when squeezed by the top and bottom text margins.
    4. **Dual X-Axis Layout**: Structural tick marks and stage names are mirrored
       identically across both the top and bottom of the heatmap frame. Top labels are
       automatically offset and aligned up-and-away from the grid to maintain space.
    5. **Ultra-Tight Compression**: Spacing parameters (`pad=4` and `y=0.99`) are
       tightened to squeeze out blank white space between titles, labels, and figures.

    Args:
        csv_file_path (str or pathlib.Path): Path to the generated CSV matrix output
            containing the 7-stage pipeline boolean data for all stations.
        home_dir (str or pathlib.Path): Root or target destination directory where
            the finalized visualization image assets will be compiled and written.
        ofs (str): Name of the operational forecast system being audited
            (e.g., 'cbofs', 'dbofs', 'necofs').

    Returns:
        None: Saves generated high-resolution (150 DPI) PNG visualization charts
        directly into the target `home_dir`.

    Raises:
        ImportError: Raised and caught internally if any dependency (`pandas`,
            `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `numpy`) is missing from the environment,

    The skill run writes ``control_files/station_ledger_{ofs}.csv``, which
    records *why* a station stopped progressing. This tool records *how far*
    each station got. Joining the two turns a bare "No" in the stage matrix
    into an explanation.

    Per-bin ADCP prunings are kept apart from station-level drops. A bin
    removed for sitting below the model bottom does not stop its parent
    station, which is still assessed on the bins that remain, so those
    records are returned as a count rather than as the station's reason.

            Ledger rows stamped ``all`` (stages whose artifacts are shared

            different ``filetype`` are skipped, so a ``-t fields`` run's
            drop reasons are not attributed to the stations audit.

        their parent station, and the earliest pipeline stage winning when
        a station was recorded at more than one. ``bin_prunes`` maps the
        same key to ``(bin_count, sample_reason)`` for below-bottom bin
