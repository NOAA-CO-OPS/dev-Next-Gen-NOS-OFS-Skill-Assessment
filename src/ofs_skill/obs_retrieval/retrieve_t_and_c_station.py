"""
Retrieve time series observations from NOAA Tides and Currents (CO-OPS) API.

This module provides functions to retrieve tidal observations, water level,
temperature, salinity, currents, and other oceanographic data from NOAA CO-OPS
stations, as well as tidal predictions and nearest station finding capabilities.

The retrieval is performed in 30-day chunks to handle API limitations. Every
CO-OPS HTTP call is gated by a module-level semaphore (see
``_rate_limited_get``) so upstream parallelization cannot exceed a safe
concurrent-request ceiling, and transient errors are handled with
full-jitter exponential backoff (see ``_get_with_retry``). Water temperature
and salinity additionally fall back to a ``PHYSOCEAN`` backup URL when the
primary endpoint exhausts retries.

For ``variable == 'currents'`` the module fans out to one datagetter call per
ADCP bin (``&bin=N``) and returns a ``dict[int, DataFrame]`` keyed by bin
number — see :func:`_retrieve_currents_all_bins` and the wiki page
"CO-OPS ADCP current processing" for the full flow.

# Global CO-OPS concurrency cap + pacing (issue #98)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CO-OPS throttles aggressively when many historical datagetter requests
# come from one IP at once. Two measures guard against this:
#
#   1. Semaphore caps concurrent in-flight CO-OPS GETs process-wide,
#      decoupling HTTP pressure from upstream ThreadPoolExecutor sizing
#      (``write_obs_ctlfile`` otherwise fans out 4 vars x 6 stations = 24
#      concurrent workers).
#   2. Minimum inter-request gap paces the START of each GET so the
#      sustained request rate stays below CO-OPS's per-IP threshold.
#      This is what lets long historical windows retrieve 100% of
#      chunks; relying on backoff alone to recover AFTER a 403 doesn't
#      work when CO-OPS's throttle window outlasts the retry budget.

# (concurrency=4, no pacing) still dropped ~1.6% of chunks to exhaustion.

            data availability with the short probe (issue #239) instead
            of downloading the full window for every bin. Only the
            ctl-file creation stage sets this — the obs-retrieval stage
            needs the actual timeseries and keeps full downloads.

    Returns:
        For ``variable == 'currents'``:
            ``dict[int, pd.DataFrame]`` keyed by ADCP bin number. Each
            DataFrame carries per-bin depth via ``df.attrs['depth']`` (also

            (the last used by the model-CTL writer to resolve depth for

    Flow:
      1. Fetch deployment metadata (orientation, sensor_depth) and bins
         metadata (per-bin depth, real_time_bin) from MDAPI.
      2. Branch on mounting type (issues #140, #141):
         - ``side``: collapse to a single virtual station at
           ``sensor_depth`` using the bins endpoint's ``real_time_bin``.
           Side-looking ADCPs sample one depth horizontally across a
           channel, so the historical fan-out to N bins all at depth=0
           produced N redundant comparisons against the model surface
           layer.
         - ``up``/``down``: keep per-bin fan-out, reading depths from
           the bins endpoint (which always populates them for these
           orientations).
         - ``unknown``: log a WARNING and treat as up/down (per-bin
           fan-out) so the run continues with the per-bin depths the
           bins endpoint reports.
      3. Stamp ``df.attrs['orientation']`` and ``df.attrs['mounting_type']``
         from the deployments endpoint (the per-bin entry never carries
         orientation; the station endpoint does not either). This is
         the source-of-truth fix for issue #141 — previously orientation
         was read from each bin entry and always came back empty,
         causing every downward-looking station to be silently mislabeled
         as upward in plot titles.

    When ``only_bins`` is provided, the bin iteration is restricted to
    that set — short-circuits the CO-OPS HTTP traffic when a user has
    supplied a currents-bins override CSV listing only specific bins.

    ``availability_probe=True`` (ctl-file creation only, issue #239)
    replaces the full-window per-bin downloads with the availability
    probe: metadata resolution, the deployment-summary CSV export, and
    the mounting tally are unchanged, and the returned dict has the
    same shape and ``df.attrs``, but each DataFrame holds only the
    short confirmation sample rather than the full window.

    Returns ``dict[int, DataFrame]`` keyed by bin number, or ``None`` if
    no bin yielded any in-window data.
