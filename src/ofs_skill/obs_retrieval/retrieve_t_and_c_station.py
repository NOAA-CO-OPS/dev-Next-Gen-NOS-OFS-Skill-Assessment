"""
Retrieve time series observations from NOAA Tides and Currents (CO-OPS) API.

This module provides functions to retrieve tidal observations, water level,
temperature, salinity, currents, and other oceanographic data from NOAA CO-OPS
stations, as well as tidal predictions and nearest station finding capabilities.

The retrieval is performed in 30-day chunks to handle API limitations. Every
CO-OPS HTTP call is gated by a module-level semaphore (see
``_rate_limited_get``) so upstream parallelization cannot exceed a safe
concurrent-request ceiling, and transient errors are handled with
full-jitter exponential backoff (see ``_get_with_retry``). Water temperature
and salinity additionally fall back to a ``PHYSOCEAN`` backup URL when the
primary endpoint exhausts retries.

For ``variable == 'currents'`` the module fans out to one datagetter call per
ADCP bin (``&bin=N``) and returns a ``dict[int, DataFrame]`` keyed by bin
number — see :func:`_retrieve_currents_all_bins` and the wiki page
"CO-OPS ADCP current processing" for the full flow.

# Global CO-OPS concurrency cap + pacing (issue #98)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CO-OPS throttles aggressively when many historical datagetter requests
# come from one IP at once. Two measures guard against this:
#
#   1. Semaphore caps concurrent in-flight CO-OPS GETs process-wide,
#      decoupling HTTP pressure from upstream ThreadPoolExecutor sizing
#      (``write_obs_ctlfile`` otherwise fans out 4 vars x 6 stations = 24
#      concurrent workers).
#   2. Minimum inter-request gap paces the START of each GET so the
#      sustained request rate stays below CO-OPS's per-IP threshold.
#      This is what lets long historical windows retrieve 100% of
#      chunks; relying on backoff alone to recover AFTER a 403 doesn't
#      work when CO-OPS's throttle window outlasts the retry budget.
#
# Tuned against a 14-month stofs_3d_atl run where the earlier settings
# (concurrency=4, no pacing) still dropped ~1.6% of chunks to exhaustion.
