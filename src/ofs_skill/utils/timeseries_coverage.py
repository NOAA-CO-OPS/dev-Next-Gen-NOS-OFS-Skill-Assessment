"""
Helpers to check whether cached time-series artifacts cover the run window.

The 1D pipeline caches its intermediate artifacts (``*_station.obs``,
``*_model.prd``, ``*_pair.int``) under filenames that do not encode the
assessment start/end dates. A persistent working directory can therefore
serve files left over from an earlier run window. Downstream, the plotting
step crops every series to the current window
(``combine_obs_across_casts``), so a stale artifact renders as a one-point
plot when the two windows are adjacent (daily operational runs share a
boundary timestamp) or as a blank plot when they are disjoint. Rolling
windows (e.g. a 7-day assessment re-run daily) are subtler: a stale file
overlaps most of the new window but is missing exactly the newest data.

These helpers let the existence checks in ``get_skill``, ``get_node_ofs``,
and ``create_1dplot`` detect stale artifacts and trigger regeneration
instead. ``remove_stale_artifact`` is the shared deletion path: it refuses
targets that resolve outside the artifact directory and tolerates a
concurrent run having already deleted the file.
