    """
    Read and parse an OFS control file.

    Control files contain mappings between observation stations and model nodes,
    including node indices, depth levels, bias corrections, and station IDs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Path to the control file to be parsed

    Returns
    -------
    lines : List[List[str]]
        Raw parsed lines from the control file, each line split into fields
    nodes : List[int]
        Model node indices (column 0)
    depths : List[int]
        Depth level indices (column 1)
    shifts : List[float]
        Bias correction shifts to apply to model data (last column)
    ids : List[str]
        Observation station IDs (second-to-last column)

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If the control file does not exist
    ValueError
        If the control file format is invalid

    Notes
    -----
    Control file format (space-delimited):
        <node> <depth> <lat> <lon> <station_id> <shift>

    Example line:
        145 0 37.5 -76.3 8573364 0.0

    where:
        - node: Model node index (145)
        - depth: Depth level index (0 for surface)
        - lat, lon: Station location
        - station_id: Observation station ID (8573364)
        - shift: Bias correction in meters (0.0)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> filename = "control_files/cbofs_wl_model_station.ctl"
    >>> lines, nodes, depths, shifts, ids = parse_ofs_ctlfile(filename)
    >>> print(f"Found {len(nodes)} stations")
    Found 42 stations
    >>> print(f"First node: {nodes[0]}, station: {ids[0]}")
    First node: 145, station: 8573364
