Model File Validation

Pre-open validation of model netCDF files so that incomplete, corrupt,
or structurally inconsistent files are dropped with a warning instead
of crashing the multi-file open or the extraction that follows
(issue #194: multi-month runs failing on files left behind by a
forecast interruption).

Each local file is opened individually and checked for:

1. **Readability** — the file opens under the engine chosen for the
   batch. Zero-byte files, garbage, and truncated HDF5 files fail here.
2. **A usable time axis** — the concat dimension exists and has at
   least one step. Header-only files written during an interrupted
   forecast fail here.
3. **A strictly increasing time axis** — the full time coordinate is
   loaded and must be strictly increasing. This is the truncation
   detector for NetCDF-3: libnetCDF silently zero-fills reads past
   EOF (no error!), so a file truncated by an interrupted forecast
   opens cleanly and returns zeros for the missing records — including
   time values of 0, which later produce duplicate/non-monotonic
   timestamps that crash resampling (and quietly poison the data
   before that). Since time is a record variable, any truncation deep
   enough to lose data corrupts the time tail, so this check catches
   it. Truncated HDF5 files fail at open instead (check 1).
4. **Data variables present** — a file with coordinates but no data
   variables is dropped.

After the per-file checks, dimension sizes are compared across the
surviving files: a file whose non-time dimensions disagree with the
majority of the batch (e.g. a different number of sigma layers or mesh
nodes) is dropped, since the multi-file combine would otherwise fail.
The ``station`` dimension of stations files is exempt — differing
station counts are legitimate (grid updates) and are handled downstream
by ``remove_extra_stations``, which slices files to the common set.

Remote URLs are passed through unvalidated: per-file remote opens are
expensive, and NODD-served files are the canonical copies. The
h5netcdf open-time fallback in ``intake_model`` still protects that
path.
