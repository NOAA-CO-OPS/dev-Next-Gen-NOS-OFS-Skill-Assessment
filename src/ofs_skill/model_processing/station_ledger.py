"""
Station-drop ledger.

The 1-D skill workflow reduces the set of observation stations at several
independent points before a station finally lands (or fails to land) in the
per-variable skill CSV. Historically these reductions were scattered across
modules and only surfaced as ``INFO``/``ERROR`` log lines, which made the
final station count look non-deterministic to users (see issue #200, active
issue #1: "45 raw obs stations -> 32 in the CSV, and changing the search
radius swaps which IDs survive without changing the count").

This module provides a single, in-memory ledger that records, per station,
the stage at which it was dropped and why. It is deliberately dependency-free
(no pandas requirement to record; pandas only used for the optional CSV dump)
and side-effect-light so it can be threaded through the existing pipeline
without changing any matching/pairing behaviour.

Typical use::

    ledger = StationLedger(ofs='necofs', variable='water_level',
                           whichcast='hindcast', filetype='stations')
    ledger.note_stage('obs_inventory', count_in=120)
    ledger.note_stage('obs_data_available', count_in=59, count_out=45)
    ...
    ledger.drop('8531680', stage='node_match',
                reason='nearest model station 6.2 km away (> 4.0 km cutoff)')
    ...
    ledger.log_summary(logger)
    ledger.to_csv(path)   # optional

The ledger never raises on a bad record; recording problems must never take
down a skill run. All public methods are safe to call from worker threads
because appends to a Python list and dict writes keyed by unique station ID
are atomic under CPython's GIL for these simple operations, and we further
guard mutation with a lock.

    -----
    The instance holds a ``threading.Lock`` to guard mutation from worker
    threads. That lock is excluded from ``__init__`` (``init=False``) and is
    recreated on unpickling via ``__getstate__``/``__setstate__`` so the
    ledger can be safely deep-copied or sent across a process boundary; a
    fresh lock is created for the copy rather than attempting (and failing)
    to pickle the original. In the current workflow the ledger is shared
    between threads via a shallow ``copy.copy`` of ``prop`` (same lock,
    intentional); the pickling support only guards future use under
    process-based parallelism.
