def pandas_merge(filepath, df, datecycle, prop):
    """
    Merges/appends a single model cycle time series dataframe to an existing
    dataframe containing all model cycle time series.
    Called by get_node_ofs.py.

    Performance note
    ----------------
    Historically this re-read the growing on-disk CSV and did a full outer
    merge on every single model cycle, which made the horizon workflow scale
    as O(cycles**2) on CSV I/O -- painful for week+ windows. When an in-memory
    accumulator is available on ``prop`` (see ``accumulate_cycle`` /
    ``flush_horizon_series``), get_node_ofs uses that instead and this
    disk-merge path is only a fallback for callers that still pass a filepath.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath: path to existing dataframe with previously merged model cycles.
    df: dataframe of new model cycle series to be merged onto existing
    dataframe.
    datecycle: column name string with date and model cycle of series
    to be merged.
    prop: ModelProperties object (``prop.datecycles`` lists the model
    cycle columns to keep from the existing dataframe).

    Returns
    -------
    df: merged dataframe with existing & new model cycle series, merged
    on the integer date-component columns; the julian column is taken
    from the new cycle series (rows only present in the existing
    dataframe carry NaN julian).

    Stash a single model-cycle series in an in-memory accumulator on ``prop``

    model cycles rather than quadratically on disk I/O.

    The accumulator lives at ``prop._horizon_accumulator`` as a dict keyed by
    ``station_key`` -> list of (datecycle, single-cycle dataframe). It is
    flushed to CSV by ``flush_horizon_series`` once all cycles are loaded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prop : model properties object (carried across all cycle iterations).
