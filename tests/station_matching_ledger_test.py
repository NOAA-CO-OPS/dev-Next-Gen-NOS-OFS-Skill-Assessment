"""
Regression tests for observation-station matching, filtering, and the
station-drop accounting ledger (issue #200, active issue #1).

The user reported that for NECOFS water level the pipeline produced fewer
stations than the legacy Fortran package and that changing the model-station
search radius swapped *which* station IDs survived without changing the total
count. Investigation showed the reductions happen at several independent,
previously-silent stages. These tests lock in:

1. ``index_nearest_station`` matches within the km cutoff and marks stations
   beyond it as ``NaN`` (FVCOM branch).
2. Stations beyond the cutoff are recorded on an attached ``StationLedger``
   with an explanatory ``node_match`` reason.
3. Two obs stations resolving to the same model location (many-to-one) are
   retained but surfaced as a ``node_match_collision`` ledger note.
4. The ledger summary/accounting API records per-stage counts and per-station
   drop reasons and never raises.

No network or model downloads are required; everything runs on tiny synthetic
arrays.
