"""Regression test for ``write_ofs_ctlfile`` under ``data_vars='minimal'``.

PR #163 commit ``e26291f`` flipped ``intake_scisa`` to combine multi-file
station datasets with ``data_vars='minimal'``, which keeps static mesh
vars (``lon``, ``lat``, ``h``, ``zcoords``) at their native 1-D shape
instead of replicating them along the concat time dim. ``indexing.py``
was migrated to handle both shapes via ``_static_coord_1d``, but
``write_ofs_ctlfile.py`` was missed in that pass and continued to use
``[0, node_idx]`` time-leading accesses in several branches. On a fresh
run (no ``.ctl`` files cached) those raise ``IndexError`` because the
coords are now 1-D.

This test pins the fix by:

1. Building a synthetic two-file FVCOM stations dataset and combining
   them with ``data_vars='minimal'``/``concat_dim='time'`` — exactly
   what ``intake_scisa`` does post-PR.
2. Running the stations-mode FVCOM branch of ``write_ofs_ctlfile``
   through to a written ``.ctl`` file.
3. Parsing the file back and asserting the lat/lon columns match the
   source 1-D arrays at the requested node indices.

We deliberately exercise only one branch (FVCOM stations / scalar) —
the other branches (FVCOM fields, SCHISM stations, STOFS-3D x/y,
ADCIRC) follow the same ``_static_coord_1d`` + ``[node_idx]`` pattern
and would all fail under the same condition pre-fix, so one branch is
sufficient to lock in the migration.
