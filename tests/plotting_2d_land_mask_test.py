"""Regression tests for the land overlay used by the static 2D maps.

``plot_2d_scalar_map`` and ``plot_2d_current_quiver_map`` paint land over
the gridded data so interpolation cannot bleed ashore. Natural Earth's
``physical/land`` polygons, however, treat the Great Lakes as land -- lakes
are published as a separate feature rather than being cut out of land. The
overlay therefore covered the *entire* domain of every Great Lakes OFS, and
``plot_leafletJSON.py`` produced a map with correct extent, coastlines and
colorbar range but no data drawn at all.

This is the same misclassification ``processing_2d`` already works around on
the data side, where the global land mask is skipped for ``GREAT_LAKES_OFS``
and the OFS shapefile mask is relied on instead.

``_land_without_lakes`` subtracts the lakes so the overlay covers only real
land. When the geometry cannot be built it returns ``None``, and callers
must then draw land *beneath* the data -- degrading to slight bleed-through
rather than back to a blank map.

    a different Natural Earth vintage -- or a cartopy release whose default
    points at one -- moves the boundary vertices enough to flip a probe from
    inside the lake to outside it. That produced intermittent CI failures on
    unrelated PRs, naming a different lake on each platform (issue #329).
