"""
Tests for continuation runs (issue #211).

A continuation run passes the full assessment window plus
``--Continue_Run`` and extends the artifacts it already has instead of
regenerating them: an existing ``.obs``/``.prd`` that starts at the
window start but stops short of the end gets only its missing tail
fetched or extracted, merged in at the seam. Everything downstream
(``.int``, skill CSVs, plots) is recomputed over the full series.

The safety property under test throughout is that continuation is only
ever an optimization: every case it cannot handle confidently -- a file
that starts too late, duplicate timestamps, a hole at the seam, an empty
tail -- must fall back to the pre-existing full-regeneration path rather
than write a spliced series.

Covers:
- the three-state classifier ``classify_coverage`` and the
  ``covers_run_window`` wrapper built on it,
- ``continuation_start`` (where a tail fetch resumes),
- the text-level merge in ``ofs_skill.utils.series_continuation``
  (dedup, ordering, seam gap, atomic write, blank-file contract),
- the reuse gates ``_ensure_obs_files`` / ``_ensure_prd_files``,
- ``.int`` invalidation in ``_ensure_paired_data_exists``.
